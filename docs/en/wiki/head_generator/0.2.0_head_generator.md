## How to create a resource pack for Head Generator

To add custom heads to Head Generator using a resource pack, there are two different ways to generate skins: using "textures" and "models".

## Important if you have made a resource pack in 0.1.2
We changed the base folder of the models from `models/heads` to `fzmm_models/heads` because it generated an error in the minecraft logs since they are not compatible models for vanilla.

### Textures

1. Create a normal resource pack and place the head textures in the `assets/fzmm/textures/heads` folder. The textures should be 64x16 images or larger in the PNG format, with only the first 64x16 pixels being used.

2. Use the resource pack like any other. When you go to the head generator screen, the heads will be added to the list and arranged alphabetically.

3. To find the heads more easily, you can add them to your favorites.

#### Skins
Since 0.2.0 you can use 64x64 textures, if you add it as a layer and hit the save skin button it will be saved with the texture overlaying the skin, which can be used for simple skin edits.

Note: no 64x64 skin is included in the default textures.

### Example

You can check out the resource pack [FZMM Head generator example.zip](https://github.com/Zailer43/FZMM-Mod/files/10303878/FZMM.Head.generator.example.zip) to see how it's done.

This example resource pack adds the following textures:
- Blue mask
- Ocelot mask

### Models

To add custom heads to Head Generator using models, follow these steps:

1. Create a JSON file in the following folder: `assets/fzmm/fzmm_models/heads`. The JSON files support the following structure:

```json5
{
  "paintable" boolean, // Used to indicate whether to have color picker,
  // the color that modifies the color picker is "selected_color". optional
  
  "textures": TextureObject[],
  
  "colors": ColorObject, // optional
  
  "steps": StepObject[]
}
```
2. Use the resource pack like any other. When you go to the head generator screen, the heads will be added to the list and arranged alphabetically.

3. To find the heads more easily, you can add them to your favorites.

#### Objects

##### TextureObject

```json5
{
  "path": String, // The path of the texture in the resource pack, for example: "fzmm:textures/model_textures/texture.png"
   "id": String // The id used to identify the texture for use
}
```

##### ColorObject

```json5
{
  "color_hex": String, // the default color, currently only the "selected_color" color can be modified via GUI.
  // Example: #FFFFFF
  
   "id": String // The id used to identify the color for use
}
```

#### Possible StepObjects

##### Select texture
Selects a texture that will be used in the following steps. The default selected texture is the base skin, its id is `base_skin`

```json5
{
  "type": "select_texture",
  "texture_id": String // The id defined in textures
}
```

##### Select color
Selects the color to be used in the next step, by default there is no color selected, the only color that can currently be modified via GUI is `selected_color`.  White is used if no color is found

```json5
{
  "type": "select_color",
  "color_id": String // The id defined in colors
}
```

##### Delete
Deletes pixels from the selected area in the final texture

```json5
{
  "type": "delete",
  "area": Area // the area where the pixels will be deleted
}
```

##### Copy
Copies an area from the selected texture and places it in the final texture

```json5
{
  "type": "copy",

  "source": Area, // The area of the selected texture where the pixels will be copied

  "destination": Area, // The area of the final texture where the copied pixels will be placed,
  // this value is optional and if not specified, the same values of "source" will be used

  "add_hat_layer": boolean, // if true, it adds the first layer of the source in the destination
  // and adds the second layer of both, this value ignores "hat_layer" of source and destination,
  // this value is optional and by default is false

  "overlap_source_hat" boolean, // if true, it adds the first and second layer of the source in the destination,
  // this value ignores "hat_layer" of source and destination, this value is optional and by default is false
  
  "degrees": int, // rotates the texture when placing it in the destination but rotating it from its center,
  // this value is optional and by default is 0
  
  "mirror_horizontal": boolean, // applies a horizontal mirror to the copied texture,
  // it is applied after rotating with degrees, this value is optional and by default is false
  
  "mirror_vertical": boolean // applies a vertical mirror to the copied texture,
  // it is applied after rotating with degrees, this value is optional and by default is false
}
```

##### Fill color
Fills an area with the selected color using the specified algorithm

```json5
{
  "type": "fill_color",
  
  "area": Area, // the area to be filled with the selected color
  
  "algorithm": String // the type of algorithm to be used to obtain the color, possible algorithms:
  // * solid: uses the selected color without modifying
  // * multiply: multiplies the selected color and the color of the pixel to be changed,
  // obtains a result more similar to the selected color if the selected pixel is in grayscale and is whiter
}
```

##### Desaturate
Removes the color of the selected area and converts it to grayscale

In the default resource pack it is only used by Fill color with multiply algorithm in the `Paint head`, as it desaturates the color of the specified skin, since in this case it cannot be desaturated previously in a resource pack

```json5
{
  "type": "desaturate",
  
  "area": Area // the area to be desaturated
}
```

##### Area
Represents an area in a Minecraft skin model, with information about its position, size, and whether it includes the hat layer or not

```json5
{
  "offset": String, // The offset of the area
// Possible values are "HEAD", "BODY", "RIGHT_ARM", "RIGHT_LEG", "LEFT_LEG", "LEFT_ARM"

  "hat_layer": boolean, // Whether the area includes the hat layer or not

  "x": int, // The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the area

  "y": int, // The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the area

  "width": int, // The width of the area

  "height": int // The height of the area
}
```



### Examples
You can find examples of the models in: https://github.com/Zailer43/FZMM-Mod/tree/405a95f31c199b3b0ff415477a5e10b8c888e1e9/src/main/resources/resourcepacks/fzmm_default_heads/assets/fzmm/fzmm_models/heads

## Q: Can I generate a head without internet?
A: You can't, you need to have internet to access the mineskin API and send them the skin, so they upload it to a minecraft account, and then give you the value of the skin, you also need internet to load the skin.

## Q: Can I speed up the generation of heads?
A: You can do it by associating **your Google account** in [mineskin](https://mineskin.org/apikey) and entering your API Key in the mod configuration, it will make uploading skins **1-2 seconds faster**

## Q: Where did you get the heads that the mod currently contains
A: Mostly from [NameMC](https://namemc.com) and some from [Minecraft-Heads](https://minecraft-heads.com), I have cropped them and deleted the unnecessary pixels of the head
